# **Week 1**

Well that went fast... Where has the week gone!?


### **Week 1 Goals**
1. Understand and able to describe some OOP principles - encapsulation, SRP 
2. Able to effectively pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Learn basic TTD best practices
4. Am able to follow and effectively debug some programmes with errors 

### **Plan**
1. Research and read about OOP, work through OO exercises in the week outline 
2. Daily pairing sessions with different pair partners - I will be requesting feedback through a short googleform to help improve myself
3. Attend the TDD workshop and practice throughout the Boris Bikes challenge
4. Come up with a simple debugging process and attend the debugging workshop


## **Daily Goals**

#### Tuesday:
- Goal: Understand and able to describe some OOP principles - encapsulation, SRP
- Plan: Research, read and work through the OO exercise, try and track progress.

#### Wednesday:
- Goal: Finish learning and understanding basic principles of encapsulation and SRP.
- Plan: Finish the Secret Diary Exercise.

#### Thursday:
- Goal: Learn some basic TDD principles and be able to implement them within tests
- Plan: Attend the workshop and practice through the Boris Bike challenge
- [Evidence: Boris Bikes Challenge](https://github.com/beca-g/Boris_Bikes/commits/master) * *unfinished but still learnt the basics* *

#### Friday:
- Goal: Learn more about debugging, come up with and try to stick to a basic debugging process.
- Plan: Work through the Debugging_Fizzbuzz exercise.
- [Evidence: Debugging_FizzBuzz exercise](https://github.com/beca-g/debugging_fizzbuzz)
- [Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qHLj0eAbMWxN59ezpFbyMFaLbqQlAj15eXcwgTPXgP4/edit)


## **Reflection**

***Did you meet all of the goals set this week?***   
Unfortunately not. This week has been aa whirlwind of information and I have come to the conclusion that I need to set myself smaller more concise goals that are actually (possibly, because who knows) achievable. I'm finding it extremely hard to come to the realisation that I won't be able to finish everything I start and need to get over it before it eats me alive! 
BUT let's just concentrate on what I have achieved...
 - I learnt the basic principles of Encapsulation, which refers to the idea of keeping data with methods that operate on that data. I used diagram's to visualise this and are now able to explain it (in a round about way) to another member in my cohort.
 - I also learnt the basic principles of SRP (The Single Responsibility Principle) which state that one class and or method should have a single responsibility.
 - I worked out a basic debugging process that I have been trying to stick to when working through my colossal amount of errors...! * *errors are your friend, errors are your friend* *
 
 ***Best bits of the week?***   
 I absolutely loved the pairing session, I learn so much from collaborating with someone else. I have been requesting feedback via my feedback form and so far have received some great and helpful feedback. Its been a great way for pairs to note an improvement or better yet a pat on the back without feeling awkward or uncomfortable. [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WgmnQF4tuyHTlt3WGhgaQ6QIj_IVHzyxHuD7C64SQVs/edit)

***What would you improve or change moving forward?***   
Firstly, I need to plan my time better, as I mentioned above I can't finish everything so need to use my time to understand everything. I feel like I maybe missed out on grasping a better understanding of TDD as I spent a lot of time trying to finish things.
Secondly, I need to factor in breaks, I've been pulled up on this a couple of times now in pairing sessions - planning on downloading a plug in to remind me to take breaks! 

**Improvements:**
- I would like to improve my understanding of TDD and writing tests.
- Sticking to my debugging process - read everything!
