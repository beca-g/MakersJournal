# **Week 2**

### **WK2_GOALS**
1. Continue using all skills gained from week 1
2. Be able to break one class into two and while maintain test coverage
3. Understand mocking and be able to unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explore Encapsulation and SRP further and look into Abstraction
5. Review another persons code and give meaningful feedback

### **PLAN**
1. Practise all skills learnt from week 1 through exercises and the afternoon challenge
2. Work through the [Refactoring](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/refactoring.md) practical
3. Research mocking and understand basic fundamentals, apply to an exercise or the afternoon challenge
4. Research the four pillars of OOP, use videos and materials provided from Makers
5. Attend and take part in the code review workshop


## **Daily Goals**

#### Monday:
- Goal: Continue learning about OOP principles, able to explain Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and possibly Polymorphism .
- Plan: Research and watch videos explaining this.
- [video, with nice diagrams and simple explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8)

#### Tuesday:
- Goal: Improve my current diagramming method.
- Plan: Attend the Diagramming workshop and research any further methods.
- [Diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E4xACM11yjKUHPTFB8P_k8nsoV_etfmjsnYLrJlWCWs/edit) made using [mural](app.mural.co) and recommended by KC! 

#### Wednesday:
- Goal: Be able to easily break one class into two and while maintain test coverage
- Plan: work throught the refactoring practical and have a coach or cohort member review.
- [Weekend_challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge) * *Yet to be validated* *

#### Friday:
- Goal: Work through the 'Testing OO Relationships using Mocking' practicial.
- Plan: Work through pratical and research where necassary when stuck. Get the practical reviewed by a coach for anything that could be improved or done differnetly.

## **Reflection**

***Did you meet all of the goals set this week?***   
I maneged to get a lot more done than last week, I think I am finally sliiping into the Makers routine. There are a couple of exercises that I will go back to when I have time.
Again, lets concentrate on everything that I have achieved this week.
- I have gained a further understanding of the 4 pillars OOP and I have been activally trying to demonstrate through the afternoon challenge and will apply this throughout the  Takeaway challenge this weekend.
- I have grasped a basic understanding of mocking and had the practical 'Testing OO relationships using Mocking' valided by a coach. Going through this with a coach really helped and I will be sending my code to be revied mroe often. 
- During the weekend challenge I planned using a diagram and the 'black box method'. This really helped me not only keep track of where I was in the challenge but also have an idea of how I would get to the solution. Thinking back now I should have gone back to my plan/diagram everytime I made a method that wasnt on the original plan. But I am happy with my process so far.

 ***Best bits of the week?***   

 Again, my favourite part of the week has been the afternoon pairing session, I learn so much during the afternoon. This week I was ahead in the challenge during two of my pairing sessions, I enjoyed going back over what I had learnt, it was also a good way to test what I have learnt.  

 ALSO - I have never loved diagraming so much, it solves almost all my probelms!!

***What would you improve or change moving forward?***    

**Plan, plan, plan.** Stop rushing into challenges/exercises and plan.

**Improvements/things to note:**
- I didn't get to look into Dependancy Injection this week so I would like to go back and do the exercise to gain a basic understanding of the concept.
