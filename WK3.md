## **Reflection**

***Did you meet all of the goals set this week?***   
I managed to meet all my goals this week and for the first time managed to finish the weekend challenge - it was a basic version but finished nonetheless. 
 
 ***Best bits of the week?***   
 Loved working with CSS and HTML this week, it's so satisfying seeing your work appear in a browser and even more satisfying playing around with making things look lovely!   


***What would you improve or change moving forward?***   
I really want to try and finish the afternoon challenge, I think this would really benifit my weekend work.
