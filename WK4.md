## **Reflection**

***Did you meet all of the goals set this week?***   
This week has been really tough, I don't think I have struggled with anything in particular. The drain of 4 weeks at an intensive bootcamp course has just taken its toll on me. I'm terrible at taking time out and find it even harder when I feel like I havenâ€™t accomplished what I set out to do.
I may not have met all my goals this week but I have learnt that it's okay to ask for help from others and meditation is medicine. 

***What would you improve or change moving forward?***   
Stop comparing myself to others, we are all on our own learning journey.

**Improvements:**
If in doubt go back to planning. Re-read, re-plan and practise. It isnt the quantity you learn its the quality of your learning.
