## **Reflection**

***Best bits of the week?***  
Learning the basics of Javascript (soon to be my favourite laungage I'm sure)
Took my very basic HTML & CSS skills to the next level and managed to stylist my weekend challenge.

***What would you improve or change moving forward?***   
I didn't get to finish the afternoon challenge, I would like to go back at some point and finish it. I would also like to go back over jQuery and implement it into my weekend bowling challnege.

**Improvements:**
- Continue working on improving CSS skills
- Go back over jQuery and implement it into my weekend challenge.
